# Temporal Graph embedding

This Paper was writting for a CS course. 

## Abstract

Temporal graph embedding is the process of transforming a graph, which changes over time, into a set of vectors. 
To show how this is done, this paper goes over different methods to use on static graphs like DeepWalk and node2vec, and show how these can be modified to be applied on temporal ones as well. 
The different methods were chosen depending on how well they help to show different aspects of the field.
Furthermore, there will be different real world applications discussed.
